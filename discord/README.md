# ðŸ§ˆ Butter Discord

A simple Discord installer and updater for Linux systems.

> **Note:** The setup process will ask for permission before modifying your shell configuration files. You can decline and manually add ~/.local/bin to your PATH if preferred.

## Features
- Installs and updates Discord with a single command
- Works with Bash, Zsh, Fish, and other shells
- User-level installation to ~/.local/bin
- Automatic shell environment configuration
- Clean uninstallation option

## Requirements
- Linux-based operating system
- wget or curl for downloading files
- sudo privileges for Discord installation

## Installation

To set up Butter Discord:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/drewgrif/butterscripts.git

# Navigate to discord directory
cd butterscripts/discord

# Make executable
chmod +x butterdis_simple.sh
```

## Usage
```bash
# Install or update Discord
./butterdis_simple.sh 

# Uninstall Discord
./butterdis_simple.sh uninstall

# Show help information
./butterdis_simple.sh help
```

## How It Works
The script:
1. Downloads the latest Discord Linux package
2. Extracts it to /opt/Discord
3. Creates necessary symbolic links and desktop entries
4. Handles cleanup during updates/uninstallation

## Project Info
